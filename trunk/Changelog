v0.320 by superelchi
	* Support for model specific contrast init.
	* Dpf type definition moved from config.h to ./lcd/TYPE/dpfmodel.h.
	* New: knowntypes_builder.py builds type info from definitions in lcd/$(TYPE)/dpfmodel.h:
	  - fw/knowntypes.py - for use by identify.py
	  - fw/knowntypes.html - simple html page listing all supported dpfs.
	* Identify.py rewrite:
	  - Commandline options (-v = verbose, -d = developer support) replace manual dev_mode editing.
	  - Extended developer support by putting dump-snipppets and disassembler-scripts in folder fw/identify.out.
	  - Detection of default brightness / contrast value.
	  - Better identification of models mit non-standard init ("fake" CRC generation).
	  - Replaced knowdpfs.py with autogenerated knowntypes.py (see knowtypes_builder.py).
	* Shebang added to all python scripts in folder fw.
	* Hint to use hiddetach if dpf is claimed by hid added to rawusb.c

Mon, 11 Apr 2011 11:55:52 +0200
v0.11alpha
	* Actually starting a changelog
	* This is a full firmware replacement, but we still talk about a
	  "hack". 
	LCD4linux (dpflib):
	* Changed resolution query
	* Support for orientation and backlight control
	* Allow addressing of several frames ("Port" statement)
	Firmware:
	* Support for USB communication with restricted command set
	  (kinda compatible to 0.1alpha)
	* Support for various LCD controllers/screens (Sitronix, Orisetech,
	  Ilitek, etc.)
	* Locked flash access ('no-brick' mode for future upgrades)
	* Power down mode: Full "deep sleep" with only RTC running
	* Auto power down on low power
	* Optional/experimental:
		- Log ADC values to log sector on flash
		- ADC voltage drawing over time (Menu: "Mon")
		- Better Load/Exec support to download applets into the DPF via USB
	* Frame specific issues:
	    - The default orientation of the Pearl 320x240 frame was changed such
	      that the USB connector is pointing down on normal display (i.e. we
	      show "Portrait"). Use the pearl_landscape TYPE option for
		  the original landscape mode.
	    - The display rotation on the 128x128 DPFs is freely configureable
	      using the Orientation option in the lcd4linux config file
