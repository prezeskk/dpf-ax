Linux driver support files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make it easier to write a driver for dpf-ax, here are two files
for use with/in drivers. These files are self-contained.
No addition files (like dpf.h, libdpf.a, ..) are needed.

They contain a "minimal" version of libdpf, including only the
code necessary to access an *ALREADY HACKED* frame. No support for
original firmware, bootloader mode and hacking/patching/flashing of fw!

You can use these files in two ways:

1. Include both files in your distribution "as is" and
   #include "dpfcore4driver.h"
   in your driver to use the code from dpfcore4driver.c.

2. Copy contents from dpfcore4driver.h at the start, and from
   dpfcore4driver.c at the end of your driver.
   For an example of this, have a look at the lcd4linux driver/patch.
