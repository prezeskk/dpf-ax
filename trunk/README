DPF remote display software distribution (dpf-ax)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a free software package to:

* Patch or reprogram digital picture frames (DPFs) based on the AX206 CPU
* Make them display system information using lcd4linux

This is a chaotically growing README. You'll have to gather some information
from here and there and probably use google, too. Sorry!

LCD4linux display notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:

* Verify that you have a decent development system (GCC, development
  libraries, subversion -- if you want to build lcd4linux) installed.
  You might also have to install the package "pkg-config", or else the
  configure procedure will likely fail.

* Configure lcd4linux: normally, the default settings will do. If you wish
  to use other drivers or cross compile, check build-dpf-lcd4linux.sh
  for configure options

* Note: For lcd4linux, you may want to have some development libraries
  installed, for example:
    libgd2-noxpm-dev  -- to display images

* Build the stuff using "make all". You need an internet connection. because 
  lcd4linux is pulled from their server.

* Try it:
  > cd lcd4linux; lcd4linux -f ../dpf.conf -F

NOTE: The orientation for the Pearl type display was changed (Details, see
Changelog) DO NOT INSTALL if you wish to keep your landscape orientation.
Later, we'll make this configureable, if there turns out to be a good
solution (there currently isn't).

Also note: NO SUPPORT! NO WARRANTY! FRIENDS DON'T MAKE FRIENDS HACK THEIR
DPF! LET ALONE NON-FRIENDS! (Bottomline: Don't ask me if I can hack your DPF).

If you wish to hack your DPF, please check the sites listed below.

Notes about the lcd4linux patch:

The 128x128 DPFs all support an 'Orientation' property, like in the example
section from a lcd4linux config file:

Display dpf {
    Driver     'DPF'
    Port       'usb0'
    Font       '6x8'
    Foreground 'ffffff'
    Background '000000'
    Basecolor  '000000'
	Orientation 0          # Orientation value from 0-3
	Backlight  backlight   # Backlight variable control
}

On the 320x240 frames, this Orientation field is not supported, unless you
wish to mirror your image for some reason. Currently, it can not be switched
at runtime. You'll need to recompile the firmware if you want to change
the default orientation.

Another implemented option as you can see, is the Backlight variable.
You can use values from 0-7, 0 turns it off, 7 is maximum brightness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting

If the lcd4linux build process fails, you may want to start over without
running the entire build procedure.
See build-dpf-lcd4linux.sh for the single steps. Right, this could also
be in a makefile to be more fool proof..
