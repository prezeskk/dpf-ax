Usage:

* Verify that you have a decent development system (GCC, development
  libraries, subversion -- if you want to build lcd4linux) installed.
  You might also have to install the package "pkg-config", or else the
  configure procedure will likely fail.

* Configure lcd4linux: normally, the default settings will do. If you wish
  to use other drivers or cross compile, check build-dpf-lcd4linux.sh
  for configure options

* Note: For lcd4linux, you may want to have some development libraries
  installed, for example:
    libgd2-noxpm-dev  -- to display images

* Build the stuff using "make all". You need an internet connection. because 
  lcd4linux is pulled from their server.

* Try it:
  > cd lcd4linux; lcd4linux -f ../dpf.conf -F

NOTE: The orientation for the Pearl type display was changed (Details, see
Changelog) DO NOT INSTALL if you wish to keep your landscape orientation.
Later, we'll make this configureable, if there turns out to be a good
solution (there currently isn't).

The source for this firmware is not yet included. Please don't ask
questions when it will be released, it will happen, once we have a fully
fool proof and working firmware including boot loader support (if you can
help there, let us know).

Also note: NO SUPPORT! NO WARRANTY! FRIENDS DON'T MAKE FRIENDS HACK THEIR
DPF! LET ALONE NON-FRIENDS! (Bottomline: Don't ask me if I can hack your DPF).

If you wish to hack your DPF, please check the sites listed below.

Troubleshooting

If the lcd4linux build process fails, you may want to start over without
running the entire build procedure.
See build-dpf-lcd4linux.sh for the single steps. Right, this could also
be in a makefile to be more fool proof..
